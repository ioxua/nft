# Ioxua's NFTs

ok, hear me out. I have NOTHING against NFTs as a technology. What I'm against is
purely speculative capitalism.

the current state of NFTs is absurd. and my projects are statements on this

this was originally inspired by a Color NFT Marketplace. In which people are going to
receive royalties based on the quantity of pixels in an image that contain YOUR color.

I was inspired by that, and that spark of geniality (?) resulted in two projects:

- a randomly letter NFT collection you can check out [here](https://opensea.io/collection/ltrs)
- a text NFT marketplace

I thought about putting some cool hats on my letters collection, but I won't be doing that.

It's dumb

as is most NFT collections
